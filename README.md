Finding Exoplanets With Machine Learning With Nasa Dataset

Yesterday i found an article on medium titled 'Using Machine Learning to Find Exoplanets With NASAâ€™s Data'  published on Medium
on Nov 18, 2020 by Ismael Araujo.
The article is based on the dataset of exoplanets from NASA's Kepler mission. The article dates from 2020 but I wanted to work on this dataset based on the work of Ismael Araujo.
I implemented a machine learning model with Keras reaching 70% accuracy on the prediction of the exoplanet state or not by training on 39 of the 49 data columns.
